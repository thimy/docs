Writing beautiful documentation is something that we deeply care about at Bump.sh. Therefore, we have spent the last few months completely rewriting our product documentation, including a structure overhaul, to address as many questions as possible and to assist you in better understanding and leveraging Bump.sh.

In it, we cover the [core concepts of API documentation](/help/getting-started/concepts/), solutions to help you [integrate Bump.sh into your tools and workflows](/help/continuous-integration/), and all the features, from [customizing your documentation](/help/customization-options/) to [deployment options](/help/publish-documentation/deploy-and-release-management/).

Our help center is open source: we warmly welcome any suggestions or corrections. You can consult our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bump-sh/docs?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing) to learn more about this.
